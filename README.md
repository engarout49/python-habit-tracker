# python-habit-tracker
By the way of tracking good and get rid of bad habits, I have created a habit tracker in Python. The habit tracker stores its data in an instance of a PostgreSQL. It also allows to analyse the performance on the tracked habits.
## Prerequisites
Prior to run the habit tracker, it requires an running instance of the PostgreSQL. Initially, I have used the PostgreSQL in version 13, but newer versions might perform as well. Secondly, a proper Python environment is required. The habit tracker has been tested against Python 3. Installing and creating the domain model, is made with the setup script. The script is located in ./ run the file together with the script in ./docs otherwise, the installation might fail.
